   As we all know in todayâ€™s world, the price of the commodity is dependent on the demand of the product. There are some products in market which costs high and are event specific i.e. been not used on a regular basis.
   In this project , we facilitate our users to rent any kind of product they wish and should return it to the seller after a certain span of time .If user is new to our website, he/she can simply sign up by clicking on Register button. Now if user wants to be a seller, then he/she can enter all his Card details and credentials related to it during Registeration. One of the major features which we are trying to provide is customized renting options for our users on the basis of the particular event. May it be traditional rituals and/or festival related or party specific items. There are also some events (which can happen in any of 365 days) like Birthdays, Poojas and Wedding Sessions. For them, we have kept a section of Plan your Special Moments which is present on Home Page wherein they can rent the product as well as services as per their convenience. When User rents any particular product, we also keep a Deposit amount which is been returned to User if he returns the rented product on time without getting any damage to it.
